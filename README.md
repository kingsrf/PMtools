# Project Management Tools Showcase: 3-Month Community Garden Build

This repository is for an assignment demonstrating the application of three core project management tools: the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the Gantt Chart, and the Kanban Board.

**Project:** Building a Community Garden in a Local Park
**Timeline:** 3 Months (June 2026 - August 2026)

## 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total project scope. It breaks the project down into four phases and 21 manageable tasks, ensuring that 100% of the required work is identified.

* **Documentation:** This WBS is structured into four phases: Planning & Approval, Site Prep & Procurement, Construction, and Launch. The tasks are high-level "work packages" to fit the aggressive 3-month timeline, assuming dedicated teams will manage the smaller details within each task.

## 2. Gantt Chart

The Gantt chart visualizes the project schedule. It plots the 21 tasks from the WBS onto a 3-month timeline, showing start/end dates, durations, and key dependencies.

* **Documentation:** The schedule runs from June 1 to Sept 1, 2026. The critical path runs through "Secure approval from Parks Dept." (1.1.3), which represents the single biggest risk to the timeline. The "Construction" phase (1.3) is heavily compressed, requiring multiple tasks to run in parallel, which assumes several volunteer teams are available.

## 3. Kanban Board

The Kanban board is an agile tool used to visualize and manage the team's *current* workflow. It shows the status of tasks as they move from "To Do" to "Done" and makes bottlenecks instantly visible.

* **Documentation:** The board snapshot is taken at the start of the "Construction" phase (August 4, 2026). It clearly shows all 11 planning/prep tasks in the "Done" column, several build tasks "In Progress," and a critical "On Hold" task ("Lay walkways & install fencing") that is blocked by a delivery delay.
